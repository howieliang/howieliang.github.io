## Abstract
This paper investigates the feasibility of using a nail-mounted array of tactors, NailTactors, as an eyes-free output device. By rim-attached eccentric-rotating-mass (ERM) vibrators to artificial nails, miniature high-resolution tactile displays were realized as an eyes-free output device. To understand how to deliver rich signals to users for valid signal perception, three user studies were conducted. The results suggest that users can not only recognized absolute and relative directional cues, but also recognized numerical characters in EdgeWrite format with an overall 89% recognition rate. Experiments also identified the optimal placement of ERM actuators for maximizing information transfer.
