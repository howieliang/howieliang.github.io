## Content

Sensors not only enable interactivity of products but also generate data. Machine learning algorithms leverage computational power and data to empower further the product to deal with design problems involved in prediction, decision, and adaptation. Tangible products support rich embodied interactions. This course aims to help the students understand the main paradigms in sensing, data collection, signal processing, and machine learning to apply them in meaningful design solutions of intelligent and interactive tangible products.

This course belongs to both Industrial Design competency areas “Math, Data, and Computing” and “Technology and Realization”.
 
The course will combine theories and practices. Through a series of lectures and workshops, you will learn the principle and functionality of the sensors and machine learning algorithms. You will develop the ability to use these signal processing methods and machine learning algorithms to deal with everyday life problems where real-world complexity, uncertainty, and changing conditions make the use of these technical solutions a necessity. Understanding the type of problems that really will benefit from the utilization of signal processing methods and machine learning algorithms and creating realistic scenarios of use for intelligent products and services is equally important.

The course will cover but is not limited to the following topics:
- Sensor data collection, pre-processing, and feature extraction.
- Real-time signal processing in time, frequency, and spatial domain.
- Supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning algorithms. 
- Evaluation of learning algorithms.
