## Abstract
This work presents LEaD, a helmet-based visual guidance system utilizing light movement in scooter drivers' peripheral vision for turn-by-turn navigation. A linear light strip mounted on a helmet navigates for scooter drivers using simple 1D light movement, which can be easily acquired and identified by peripheral vision with the on-going foveal vision task. User studies suggest that this novel system can effectively direct scooter drivers without introducing visual distractions in route-guided experiences.
