## Abstract
For makers and developers, circuit prototyping is an integral part of building electronic projects. Currently, it is common to build circuits based on breadboard schematics that are available on various maker and DIY websites. Some breadboard schematics are used as is without modification, and some are modified and extended to fit specific needs. In such cases, diagrams and schematics merely serve as blueprints and visual instructions, but users still must physically wire the breadboard connections, which can be time-consuming and error-prone. We present CircuitStack, a system that combines the flexibility of breadboarding with the correctness of printed circuits, for enabling rapid and extensible circuit construction. This hybrid system enables circuit reconfigurability, component reusability, and high efficiency at the early stage of prototyping development.

## Keywords
